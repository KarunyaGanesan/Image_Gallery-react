This is a basic Image Gallery project created using React, with a focus on rendering images dynamically using props and JavaScriptâ€™s map() function. The project demonstrates an efficient way of passing data through props and rendering lists in React components.

# Features

**Dynamic Image Rendering:** Images are displayed dynamically by mapping over an array of image objects.

**Reusable Components:** Each image is rendered through a reusable React component, receiving its details through props.

**Responsive Design:** The gallery adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience.

# Technologies Used

**React:** Core framework for building the UI
**JavaScript (ES6):** To implement map() for iterating over image data
**CSS:** For layout and responsive design
